        <h1>The Mantis Shrimp</h1>
          <p>Behold, the mantis shrimp! The mantis shrimp is no ordinary shrimp and is certainly no ordinary mantis. The mantis shrimp is unique from other ocean dwellers in many ways, such as their fascinating colors to their mating habits. The Mantis Shrimp is, without a doubt, the most interesting creature in the sea, and only gets weirder as you learn more about it.</p>

        <h2>Power</h2>
          <p>The mantis shrimp is one of the strongest creatures on the planet in terms of relative strength. Although the mantis shrimp is typically about 3.9 inches long, they can still pack a punch. The mantis shrimp punch is equivalent to the force of a bullet shot from a 22 caliber gun (<a href = "https://www.kidzone.ws/animals/mantis-shrimp.htm">See Here</a>). This punch is great for capturing prey and even breaking aquarium glass!</p>

        <h2>Speed</h2>
          <p>The mantis shrimp not only packs a powerful punch but a fast one as well. The mantis shrimp can swing at its prey in less than 800 microseconds! To put that into perspective, the human eye blinks in about 350,000 microseconds. In short, it is best to remain friends with the mantis shrimp.</p>

        <h2>Mating</h2>
          <p>Some species of the mantis shrimp are known the mate for life. Thatâ€™s right, these mantis shrimps are all about monogamy. They burrow together and share the responsibilities of protecting their eggs. Talk about romance!</p>
