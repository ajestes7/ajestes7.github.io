      Below are 10 amazing facts about the infamous mantis shrimp!
      Most mantis shrimp species grow to about 2 to 7 inches long in their adulthood..
      The eyes of mantis shrimp are located on the long stalks that can move independently, using this exceptional eyesight to detect predators and prey alike.
      Mantis shrimp either have spears or clubs as their weapons of choice, although both are equally deadly.
      The mantis shrimp attack happens about 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. This punch has a velocity of 10 meters per second, the same power of a .22 caliber bullet.
      The species of mantis shrimps with clubs oftentimes break the glass of aquariums.
      Most species of mantis shrimps live alone or with a mate, only leaving their burrow to catch prey.

      Male mantis shrimp often emit grunts at dawn and dusk, the periods of the day when theyâ€™re most likely to be hunting for food or guarding their homes. Scientists theorize that the growls are meant to attract mates and ward off competitors.
